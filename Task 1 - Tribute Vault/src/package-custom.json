            "Content-Text": "Robert Downey Jr. was born on April 4, 1965, in Manhattan, New York City. He was raised in a creative environment. His father, Robert Downey Sr. was an avant-garde filmmaker, and his mother, Elsie Ann, was an actress.\n\nHowever, this artistic upbringing was juxtaposed with the struggles of addiction that would later haunt Downey Jr. From a young age, Downey Jr. showed an interest in acting, making his debut at the age of five in his father's film \"Pound\" (1970). He attended the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York during his adolescence, honing his craft alongside future stars like Sean Astin and Zach Braff.\n\nDowney Jr.'s career began to gain traction in the 1980s, with roles in films like \"Weird Science\" (1985) and \"Less Than Zero\" (1987), where he showcased his acting range. However, his talent was often overshadowed by his struggles with substance abuse, which began in his teenage years and escalated throughout his early adulthood.\n\nDespite his personal challenges, Downey Jr. continued to garner critical acclaim for his performances, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his role in \"Chaplin\" (1992). However, his erratic behavior and frequent run-ins with the law threatened to derail his career.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Downey Jr.'s substance abuse issues reached a boiling point, leading to multiple arrests and stints in rehabilitation facilities. It wasn't until 2003, after hitting rock bottom, that he finally sought help and committed to sobriety.\n\nDowney Jr.'s career experienced a remarkable resurgence following his sobriety, marked by iconic roles in films like \"Iron Man\" (2008) and \"Sherlock Holmes\" (2009), which catapulted him to international superstardom. Today, he is not only celebrated for his talent but also admired for his resilience in overcoming personal adversity."
